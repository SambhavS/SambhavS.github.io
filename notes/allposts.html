				<h2 id="post3">Some Thoughts on Learning CS</h2>
				<p>A friend recently asked me how she could get really good at CS. I thought I could make a post that captured some of the things I've learned since starting to do CS. I'm still a noob and am towards the start of my CS career, but I feel my thoughts could still be helpful for a beginner. I read a lot of Paul Graham and tend to paraphrase him a lot when I write, so some ideas presented here will definitely seem familiar to people who have read his essays. I said, with minor modifications, the following:
				<br/><br/>
					"You could probably get there if a couple things happened:
				<br/><br/>
					1) You really believed you could do it. I think the best way is to do quite a bit of CS quite quickly and make friends with people who are good at CS/math. First, once you see that you've gotten better fast you'll realize you can keep getting better fast and maybe even increase your speed at doing so. In other words if you realize you can accelerate how fast you're getting better at CS, you'll get more motivated and actually accelerate how fast you're getting better. Second, it's the people who are really good at CS that'll make you feel like you can do it too. Once you realize the legends of CS/math etc are just normal people who try hard and have a lot of fun with what they're doing you'll be able to do it too. Also, from my experience people who do great work make you feel that you can also do great work.
					<br/><br/>
					2) You get really involved in projects. Personal projects are a whole different side of CS than theory (like learning data structures and stuff like that) and different people are good at it. I think personal projects is less 'pure' than theory in the sense that you have to do more types of things while theory is largely based on your ability to manipulate symbols (which I think is quite largely in-born). Projects are something that more types of people can get good at and definitely use different skills. For example, people who are good at making projects need to know different systems should work together, how to learn about a technology, has to think about a user, has to be able to produce creative and new ideas, and has to have a sense of design. Theory requires a smaller but very deep level of skill at a subset of these things. So I think it's totally possible for you to get very, very good at projects even if you're not at the very, very top of CS classes. 
					<br/><br/>
					3. You get lots of good CS friends. Having good CS friends is also really for getting good at CS because they can tell you all the insider secrets about their projects, how to get started, and how to do well in industry. Also, seeing their projects means that you'll have a much better idea of what projects can/should be like and you'll have a much easier time getting started. Also, having people to talk about your tests with can make you better prepared for them. 
					<br/><br/>
					By now it should be apparent that these ideas are complementary and intertwined and not distinct. Basically to get really good at CS you need to get very focused and eventually obsessed with it. Whether you get really into projects or theory or research doesn't seem to matter nearly as much as the idea that you're really involved and having fun. I'm not claiming to be very good at CS, but I can say that these are the things that helped me go from being a complete noob in CS to where I am now. Hopefully that helps."

				<h2 id="post2">On Books and Book Reviews, and Some Book Reviews </h2>
						<p>This semester it had come to my attention that I hadn't read a book for literally years. I've read hundreds or thousands of articles in the past few years, some of high quality (I think the New Yorker culture section is one of the most concentrated places for interesting writing and in particular is a great place to witness one type of great writing style) and some of lower quality (almost all articles on most sites: TechCrunch, Yahoo, most stuff linked to on FB, much of wired, a lot of the random news in the NYTimes, lots of the 'news' in the New Yorker, Buzzfeed, etc). The thing about bad writing for people who love to read, is that you're still human and drawn to it, but because you love reading you feel bad about it afterwards. It's like a pastry chef surrounded by Oreos all the time; it's hard to resist them even though you know they aren't actually very good. </p>
						<p>That summarizes much guilt and pain I've experienced in the past few years. I've probably known it's been a big problem for a while, but only started to do something about it recently. I've blocked nearly all the media sites on my computer (even the ones that sometimes have good stuff like Reddit/Hacker News/New Yorker) in order to lower my consumption of bad media. The results have been generally good but there's still room for improvement. It's not uncommon for me to go on my phone and read bad news, but the overall frequency has gone down. Reading has always been how I spend a huge amount of my time and that hasn't changed that much since blocking most media sites on my computer, but has stayed around constant. What has changed is that I've started reading books (wow, we finally got back to my stated topic) and have realized how much more rewarding the experience is and how much great content there is to read in the world. </p>
						<p>I think I got lucky in that at least a few of the books I've read were really great and did a very good job of reminding me how good it can be to read a good book. I don't want this to be a self-help blog where I recommend things for you to do and make your life better, mostly because that doesn't seem fun for me. But you can read between the lines and figure out that the person writing this (me) probably thinks that if you haven't read a full book in a long time, you should probably try it. </p>
						<p>I think that it's a good idea for me to write some reviews about books I've written so I don't forget entirely that I even read them. I can also look back and see how my tastes have changed over time or what an earlier version of myself thought. I have a hunch that Bill Gates writes book reviews partly for these reasons. These reviews probably won't be amazing because I read them throughout the last semester and have already forgotten a lot of details about them, but I'll give you the gist of how I felt about them. You can read my last post about Steven Pinker's two books; Better Angels of Our Nature was both the longest and best book I read, partly because of the beauty of the ideas in the book and partly because it showed me I was able to read long books and not to be afraid of them.</p> 
						<p>I also read <b>Never Split the Difference</b>, which was semi-recommended to me a by friend, which was a book about negotiating written by some top hostage negotiator. Some of the book's ideas were pretty interesting like intentionally pausing during sentences and how the writer was able to guess what his negotiator was thinking. Unfortunately I quit this book about 2/3 of the way because I got sick of the writing which felt sensationalistic and too self-helpy. Generally I don't like writing that preaches a lot, not because I think it's 'an insult to my intelligence', but because I get a queasy feeling that the writer is being a sort of dishonest with me. The book had all these examples where somebody magically used his very, very specific advice and it was crucial to them getting some very important situation defused or reward obtained. Based on my understanding of people, situations, and probability, he's either making these things up, twisting the stories deeply, or collecting them from people who've already changed them. Regardless of which of those things happened, it left me as a reader distrusting and unpersuaded. I could try to make the point that it's ironic about how a book about negotiation (which is a form of persuasion) was not persuasive, but I think that applies to most books on persuasion for people like me. I don't think this book was any worse than the rest of the genre.</p>

						<p>As a young and ambitious person, I think a lot about career and what I should be doing with my life and why. I think for almost anyone who thinks of themself as ambitious, it's a little bit hard to not (at least temporarily) get attracted to things other people see as paths to success. One commonly regarded path to success is that of the investment banker (or trader or rising financial analyst), who goes to Wall Street and makes his millions. What's harder to ignore is that so many people who go to top schools, like Harvard & Princeton etc, end up working there, so it can't be a field just of stupid people. So on and off, I would imagine what it would be like to work at Wall St, read up about it and then come to the understanding that those people mostly don't enjoy their life, don't really necessarily make that much money, and aren't worthy of my envy, and then forget all the lessons I learned and get tempted by the allure again. I read a book called <b>Young Money</b> where a journalist follows and interviews a bunch of kids that go to Wall St for some reason or not. I think he picked a group of people generally nicer than the average subset of Wall St, but I mentally adjusted for that when using the book to shape my worldview. Also, him picking a nice group of people gave me some sense of empathy for Wall St, which is probably important for me to get a fairer understanding of the who goes into Wall St, why they do it, and how the whole system works. The most valuable part of reading Young Money is that now I have been mostly cured of my inclination to cyclically think highly of people going to Wall St. My thought process has been simplified to "Wall St -> Kids in Young Money -> Possibly Good People getting into a deeply stressful and unrewarding field -> hopefully they exit and find meaningful things to do that make them happy." It might sound silly but this one thing that I took away, in a fairly deep way, was enough to make the book worth my time. The writing wasn't excellent and I wasn't a fan of the style but I'm grateful to have read it for this one thing it taught me. Many lives have been destroyed or derailed by desires for things that aren't good in the long term. Wall Street seems to be such a thing. I wouldn't have gone to Wall St in any conceivable universe, but just having a better understanding of it and not being tempted is relieving and helpful for developing my world view.</p>

						<p>I read Jessica Livingston's <b>Founders at Work</b>, piecewise. I'm very interested in startups so I thought it was a generally fun read. It reminds me of the idea that sometimes you need to read sort of similar variations of the same idea to really deeply understand an idea. When you do a math problem on some topic, you won't be an expert after doing the one problem. If you do 5 isomorphic problems of the exact same structure (but changing particular details just so you aren't regurgitating details) you'll have a much better understanding of that topic, and measurably so. We're all told that you get better with practice, but it's rarely noted *how* unintuitive the idea of practice is. It's absolutely strange that if you do extremely similar things over and over, that you'll learn something new. Learning is by definition absorbing something new. How can you learn if the experience is largely not new? I think this is a fundamental question that is very hard to answer. My best answer is that there are two notions of 'new': newess to the brain and comparative-newness. Comparative-newness of two actions refers to analytically saying how the actions differ. Solving 12+10 at 9:00 AM is different from solving 12+10 at 11:00 AM is different only in terms of when you solved it, and that doesn't seem like a big difference. Our default mode of evaluating newness is by comparison. It's the most intuitive way and takes advantage of a method of thinking that we have a lot of experience in. But that's not actually how the brain works. Our brain works sort of like a muscle where it can gets better at doing something once you repeat it. This is highly un-intuitive because we think of information as being exact, perfectly stored data while we think of muscles as physical objects responding to some chemical process to grow. When you learn things, you're always something new so it's hard to realize that the process of learning involves repeating something over and over. For muscles, we have the explanation that tissue tears and then regrows better and stronger. We have no good, widely-circuited notion for the brain. Our model of information is based on that of a computer, where you insert data once and it's stored forever. We're trained to think of information systems as being highly formalized, lossless, and logical system because that is how the ones we design are. Our own hardware is totally different so we do a terrible job of thinking about it. The reason the book reminded me of this is that I've read so much startup advice that very little of it seems to be new to me. In fact, you could take all I know about startups and write it on a few pages. Paul Graham says something similar about what he remembers from history books. But it's deeply wrong and misleading to say what I know about startup advice would fit on a few pages because what I know about startups is not stored as information the way it is on computers, in a nice orderly fashion, in discrete bits and bytes. Worldviews are not stored as long strings of binary; we have basically little idea of how they're started. It would probably be good for everyone to realize that we use one model of analytic thinking for everything in the physical world and it works very well, but that we shouldn't apply that model to our own brains because our brains are special and odd things. Maybe some people do that, but I rarely do and think it'd be nice if we all talked about this. I had lunch with a friend who said she read the answers to a practice test she took, as if by reading the solutions she would learn them. If she were a computer, reading the solutions would be fine. But she's not. And it's not a coincidence that she decided to think that way. It's the natural thing to do. But it's highly dangerous because it inhibits learning and gives people bad habits. I don't think it would be that bad for us to aim for half of the population to learn very explicitly to think of our brains as weird hardware that requires lots and lots of practice and to note how different we are from computers. The idea of comparing our minds to computers should be done with extreme care and it should be reiterated how different they are. I understand this is a hard thing to learn and deeply internalize. However, if it was a common fact that practice is an unintuitive thing that doesn't apply to most systems in nature, I think it would be easier and more intuitive to adapt accordingly. Also this long post about how we learn which came out of what was supposed to be a book review probably indicates my blog won't be about things I say it'll be about and also that it'll go in ways I don't expect</p>

						<p>Steven Levitt's book <b>Think Like A Freak</b> was also self-helpy but I read it because a friend was reading it and I needed a break from Better Angels of Our Nature. It seemed to have a lot of specific advice that would work in a few solutions but aren't applicable all that often. I also read their first two books and generally read a lot of books of their style (Malcolm Gladwell-ey clever social science observation) which I find really entertaining but usually less useful than they appear. It also sounded as if these few lessons would dramatically change your life. I think my whole issue with self-help books is related to the above brain-practice-weirdness. Self-help is a whole genre stuck in this model that if you upload information to your brain, it can be better so you just need to read the inspirational words. Certain truths are actually super important to living, but those hard facts are almost diametrically opposite of the stuff in self-help books. Even if you want to learn the things in the self-help book, you can't, at least not by reading them. If you want to become kind, reading about kindness is a very weak way to do it. You need to experience kindness, experience being kind, experience a vacuum of kindness. The development of brain skills is not through the entry of books into the mind, but through experiences. What books are good for is actually getting new facts and getting some seeds that will blossom into good thoughts later. But skills need to be obtained by living life. It might be sad that you can't just learn everything from reading books. But you can go and live an exciting life *and* have your brain changed and be a transformed person! That's pretty cool. I know I'm talking a lot about how we poorly conceptualize the brain because it is such a generally weird (read non-normative) thing that can't be explained by the normal models of life but I think it's justified because of how important of a thought it is and because I just thought about it. Also, the experience of reading this whole post about it is probably going to help you understand it better than if I had written one very precise good sentence about it. So you are welcome for that and if you want to learn it even better, read this post a second time. It'll be fun then too. I promise.

						<p><b>Deep Work</b> was Cal Newport's book about, well, deep work. I liked this book a lot. The central idea is that there exists deep work that requires full concentration, that that type of work is rich, rare, and meaningful, and that you should do it. I think this is a great idea. People should be talking about deep work all the time. The best types of work are deep work. Deep work is sustainable and makes life better. When you do deep work you don't feel unproductive. I want to do deep work and I want all the people in my life to do deep work. This was the first book I read after my long hiatus and I'm happy it was. It got me out of my hiatus and inspired me to do deeper things - the general priority to block all the trash media was born from it. I think I summarized the book decently but if you read it you'll take deep work more seriously and that's a valuable thing. Sometimes just talking about a thing makes it a priority. I don't think that 'Awareness' campaigns work because being aware of something usually doesn't make you care. Talking and writing about things makes you care. And I'm writing about deep work because it's something worth caring about, and at the heart of a large portion of the great things in the world. Sometimes you need to just do stupid work to make the cycles of the world work. Most great endeavours have some amount of nonsense them. But most great endeavours have really high quality deep work in them. And only some people can do that high quality deep work. I'd like to be that type of person and am pretty sure it's a lot more fun than doing nonsense. </p>
						<p>I thought it fitting for my last book review to be for <b>The Long Goodbye</b>, for some sense of closure. It was the first novel I've read in, um, very long. It was interesting and fast paced and was especially impressive that it read totally normally even though it was written over 60 years ago. Timelessness is a virtue that we rarely talk about but seems to me to be very great. Thinking about things over a tremendously long time period is hard but very worth it. That was a good lesson I realized from Better Angels of Our Nature. The current model of thinking about life in context of what we've seen in perverse because we have so much history and are at one end of it. The world has changed tremendously so it's largely inaccurate to not think about it with respect to the long trailing history. I don't do that a good job of this because it's hard but I'd like to work on it. The slang was a bit different, there weren't any mentions of modern electronics, but mostly the book was deeply relatable. I guess what's dramatic and engaging in the 20th and 21st century need not be that different when it's based in something very slow changing: human nature. The book also reminded me that books take us places. I hadn't forgotten that novels could do that, in the sense that the idea seemed new to me. But I had forgotten the feeling and being shown the excitement once again made me excited. Now there's a whole new world (or universe really) for me to explore.</p>
						<p>So those are the books I read. This post was a lot longer than I expected. I think I found a form of writing I really like. Let's see if that continues to be true. If you read till here, I admire your determination. If you know me, I appreciate your appreciation of me, because if you read till here you really must like what I have to say. See you till next time. Also, I'll be trying to make this whole blog format better in the coming days, so check back for that! (By the way, I'm probably going to end most of my posts by asking you to come back because it's natural, easy, and blog posts aren't designed to lead to good rhetorically-satisfying conclusions).</p>

				<h2 id="post1">First Post!</h2>
						<p>Most first posts, like this, are test posts and tests posts tend not to be interesting. I'll try to make this post different. I recently read a great book. It's called <b>Better Angels of our Nature.</b> The book talks about all the ways that violence has gone down over the ages. It's around 800 pages which felt very long to me, especially because I read very few books in high school. Despite its length, the book was worth the time it took to read it. Since reading it, I sometimes see some real life phenomena and remember a theme of his book; this, I believe, is a good indication that this book made an impact on my worldview. The simple fact that early-era human life was so absolutely and horrifyingly painful to so many people so much of the time is so dramatic that it makes certain major pains of life seem somewhat trivial. I also read Pinker's second book, <b>Enlightenment Now,</b> but found it less interesting. It seemed like it was mostly full of stuff I already agree with.  But I imagine that if someone disagreed with a lot of its premises (like the idea that humanism, reason, science are sort of fundamental powers of good) then he/she would likely get a lot of the experience. My next post is going to be about books in general and some other specific books I wrote, so stay tuned!</p>
