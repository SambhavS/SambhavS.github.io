				<h2 id="post6">Ideas are Messy</h2>
				For me, it's very tempting to think of simple ideas as being atoms and for great ideas to be molecules or cells, structures that are formed from more simple ideas. In a way, this view is correct and very helpful. It's nice to think of the idea of rain as being the combination of the idea of water and the idea of falling. And all complex things, by definition, are made of simple things. And much of the process of understanding is being able to describe an idea as being the combination of others you are familiar with. So, for me and probably most others, ideas are a sort of atom and building material that has the properties of creating new ideas when combined with other ideas. I think this perspective is tremendously helpful (and probably necessary) but is also simultaneously a deeply misleading view that makes it easy to ignore the nature of ideas.
<br/><br/>
				For most of my life, I thought that I could just learn everything by getting a great, big list of all the ideas I need to learn and going through them mechanically till I had learned everything. I always wondered why no straightforward million-point bullet list was composed and why we had things like schools and courses and books that would say the same thing twice or thrice. This notion is made even more confusing by the fact that there are certain types of 'ideas' that can be understood in this way, like the meaning of new vocabulary words. Of course, I found with practice that you (or at least I) can't simply go through most ideas and absorb them. But until recently I didn't understand why. The reason is that ideas aren't atoms but are complex, mutating functions that work surprisingly well with other complex, mutating functions. If ideas were just atoms we could store them in isolation if we wanted or we could at least keep them nice, aesthetic forms like tables. Instead, we store ideas in sentences, in paragraphs, and in books which are all rather messy forms of media; you can write a book with variable-length chapters, with different types of chapters, with no chapters or with a format that is difficult to describe with few words. But the amazing thing is that we're able to process these messy forms of media relatively well. Even more amazing is that we're able to process these messy forms of media *more* easily than 'clean' forms of media (like huge bullet lists) much of the time. 
<br/><br/>
				There are other things that make ideas messy. One of them is that the same words can emit a slightly different idea depending on the person who reads, how fast they read it, when they read it, how many times they read it, and what else is in their head. Words are the best model we have for ideas, but we still can't make perfect mappings between words and ideas. Thinking about the same exact idea for a while often leads to other ideas; if you mentally ask yourself 'what is my goal in life' slowly and deliberately 100 times in a row, I guarantee that at least a few *different* vague ideas will come to you. Ideas are like functions that mutate when you call them so that you get different output every time you think about them. 
<br/><br/>
				My general feeling about ideas is that they are surprisingly functional and also that playing with them is surprisingly surprising. Given that when we read a book or hear a story or think about our day we don't really know precisely what ideas show up in our head or why, the ideas in our head are rather mysterious things. I find it surprising that these mysterious ideas in our heads that just show up and have many unexplainable aspects to them all work quite neatly with each other. Even the people we might consider to be rather stupid are able to speak idiomatic English which means that they can rapidly put together a model of many diverse ideas that all fit together somewhat coherently. The functionality of ideas to work with each other is part of the reason that the atomic view is so attractive; we naturally associate many things working together with the idea of discrete and mostly stable structures. When I say that playing with ideas is surprisingly surprising, I mean that tossing around ideas leads to surprises so often that it is surprising. When I'm solving a math problem that looks unsolvable, I'll sometimes just (mostly unconsciously) think about the general ideas that surround the domain of a problem. 
<br/><br/>
				So, for example, if I'm solving a problem that has to do with triangles, I'll think about the definition of sin and cos, the formula for area, the types of triangles. And surprisingly often, this seemingly unrelated process will suddenly pull to memory a very relevant idea for solving this problem. Had you shown me this idea right after giving me the problem and asked me the chance I would have thought of this idea on my own, I would feel the chance would be close to zero. Yet this is how I solve many of the hardest problems that I solve! The Feynman problem solving method says to solve any problem, think about it very hard and then write down the correct answer. This, of course, is a sort of joke but I think an important truth lies at the heart of it. Sometimes the way to solve a problem that you don't think you can solve is to just tell yourself you can solve it and then think about it. This works more often than you think it should because it's natural to underestimate how prone ideas are to emitting other ideas when thought about. This holds true not just with thinking but also with activities that force you to think or make thinking easier. The reason I like coding and writing (and I'm sure lots of other people do too) is that I get many more interesting ideas when I write or code than if I just think (at least for certain types of ideas and problems). 
<br/><br/>
				The other implication of ideas being messy is that it makes sense to try unconventional things with them. For example, if you have two ideas about what you should do, you can ask yourself questions like: 'What would an artist do in this' or 'Which action is fundamentally simpler'. These are rather strange questions questions to ask and many of them won't get you anywhere. But maybe one will and my guess is that weird questions that don't seem to fit will actually be helpful more often than true randomness would expect. If your model of ideas is atoms, then you would not think to do weird or imprecise things when playing around with ideas.
<br/><br/>
				We all intuitively know that certain aspects of ideas can be messy; it's very apparent that relationships or conversations can be hard to explain. Perhaps, all the things I'm saying about the messiness of ideas is obvious. But I think it's all too common to think of ideas as being very predictable and understanding, explicitly, some of the ways ideas can be messy is a valuable tool. It's nice to pretend that ideas are clean, binary objects that are simply just understood or not understood because it simplifies the world around us. The problem is that version of the story leaves out much of the truth.


				<h2 id="post5">Discovering for Oneself</h2>
				<p>One feeling I've had since coming to college is that lots of dreams of mine had been killed off as I grew up. I realized that I wasn't smart enough to be a truly great mathematician and I realized that certain dreams, like to be an astronaut or firefighter, were not nearly as interesting or rewarding or practical as I had dreamt up. As I grew older, I saw things that I couldn't even dream about because it was already clear that I wasn't like the people who were best at those things: the strong athletes, the uber-gregarious and funny 'media personalities', the attractive actors etc. I think this experience is incredibly common for most people. When I told people in high school (and even now in college) that I intended to start a start-up, the most common instinctive response was to tell me that I couldn't and to be a little bit startled, as if they had met a person who didn't know some basic truth. It may or may not be true that I can't start a successful startup, but these responses came right off the bat from people who hardly knew anything about startups or me. I don't mean to blame these people, but rather to see them as indicative of the pervasiveness of the idea that dreams are things that exist outside of the accessible reality. Many dreams do fit this pattern, but I think it's dangerous to think that they all do. 
<br/><br/>

				When you think about what a dream is, it's really just something great you really, really want to do. Most great achievements come with prerequisites, but I'm really excited because I think I've found one that mostly doesn't: becoming a discoverer. Personally, the term 'discoverer' has always meant 'the first person who has discovered something.' But I think it's important to realize that discovery, in the context of the individual, is also an amazing thing. We all have moments when we feel we've realized a great truth; it could be when you learned about evolution or photosynthesis or sex or something about human nature or that lots of tasty foods have lots of sugar or butter in them. It's easy to trivialize such an accomplishment because we're aware that other people also know whatever truth we found out. But that truth might still be incredibly, incredibly valuable! Imagine how big of a difference a basic understanding of fire or farming might have meant to a prehistoric human! The world we live in has been made possible by those same great ideas that you're learning. And if you're reading this blog post, odds are quite good that you're in a fortunate situation where you can learn many new things. And something that is brand new to you, is, in the context of yourself, a discovery!
<br/><br/>

				Alright, so it sounds a bit misleading to say that learning things is the same as discovery; the important quality of discovery is that the knowledge was hard to come by and more importantly, came out of organic observation. Darwin didn't read that natural selection leads to meaningful genetic change over decades in a book; he observed and thought long and hard and then figured it out! I wage that you can do things to help you discover things organically as well. Personally, I've found this when working on programming projects. Some of the simpler data structures and algorithms we're taught about can be 'discovered' just by working on a problem and finding the best solution. In psychology, you can 'discover' a huge percentage of the underlying themes just by going about your daily life and thinking about your interactions with people. Much of elementary economics and probability theory is just a formalization of some math you intuitively might do to solve some real-life problem. When the first thinkers made these discoveries for the first time, it was much harder and slower because they didn't have the advantage of tremendous background knowledge and formalized schooling. The exciting thing for us, as it turns out, is that we can 'discover' far more things on our own with much less effort than many of the great thinkers of history. Newton himself acknowledged that much of his work would have been impossible had he not been standing upon the shoulders of giants. We have the chance to stand on much, much taller giants and can come to realizations that are profound at a proportionally greater pace, which is a big enough advantage to make up for the incredible brain power earlier thinkers had. So, unintuitive as it is, maybe don't open up the book to learn about the anatomy of a flower just yet; try opening up itself and finding out on your own.
<br/><br/>

				This, to me, is enough to get very excited about discovery. The idea that we can organically find many great ideas from all sorts of different fields is tantalizing. Stretch this over many years and you can imagine that you would get a rather large body of knowledge. I think there is one final thing that makes the dream to be a discoverer even more tantalizing. It's also probably the most shocking idea: there is much that is useful and that is new that can be discovered by totally normal people, just like you and me.
<br/><br/>

				I can't say that it's easy to casually find new fundamental truths in things like the hard sciences, which have been understood quite well for decades or centuries and have so many ideas rigidly established. But you can find soft truths outside of science that are very important. Paul Graham says this is the new way to do philosophy and I agree, but it's so different from what has traditionally been called philosophy that it's hard to call it by the same name. To differentiate from Old Age Philosophy, I'm going to call it New Age Philosophy or NAP. You probably have little insights all the time: 'hmm it seems that all the people at this conference don't like making eye contact, I wonder why' or 'hmm I met this guy but I don't feel like I know him well enough to call him my friend'. This insight can be the start of a question like 'Why do many mathematicians find it unnatural to make eye contact?' or 'When do people consider somebody to be their friend?'. And then maybe if you do some research, you might *discover* some pretty good answers to these questions. These questions might not sound as rigorous as the questions asked in academia, but they can certainly be interesting and useful to answer. And if you do come with good answers to questions like these by finding the underlying patterns or explanations, then it's rather likely that you'll be the first. Discovery in the original sense of the word! Finding good answers to these questions won't be trivially easy but it'll be doable. Even better, there's no limit to the number of useful questions you can think of and answer. There doesn't even seem to be a bound on what type of person can come up with good answers aside from imagination, creativity, enthusiasm, and communication skills (none of which can't be developed).
<br/><br/>

				I think that providing useful answers to meaningful questions that lots of people might have can be a great thing to do. Answer enough big questions well enough and the impact you have will be immense and that seems reasonable to call great. And if you're like me, finding new ideas organically and developing important explanations sound like a lot of fun. Add greatness and motivation and you have a dream. The world, at this moment, for people who have internet and some sort of means to make a living, seems deeply nurturing for discovery. The learning resources, the tools, and the environment to emit insights are all there. Now all that's left is to go out and discover.</p>


				<h2 id="post4">On Finding a Place to Live</h2>
				<p>This weekend my friends and I finally found a place to live for next year. It was not a particularly fun process but I wanted to reflect on it. Since I've gotten to college, I've gotten a feeling that a lot of adulthood is dictated by processes of application, evaluation, negotiation, and eventual decision making based on your optimization of values you have, where people give you some general advice but there's no really good agreed-upon authority to help you with. This differs a lot from things like school, especially for people in highly technical/precise fields like math/CS/physics, where you have highly reliable sources of information. This pattern seems to apply to college apps, internships, and now housing. I imagine it also applies to buying real estate, dating, and actual jobs. What these things seem to have in common is that they're all among the most important decisions you make in your life; where you live, with whom you live with, and what job you do are collectively a pretty big chunk of life. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of applying, negotiating, or making important decisions but this seems to be a pretty unavoidable and impactful set of skills, so perhaps I should put some effort to get better at it. 
<br/><br/>
				I think that people get sub-optimal results in all of these fields precisely because they're so important. It's scary and uncomfortable to think about big decisions and you inevitably wonder about whether you're making a huge mistake. So instead we don't think about it and make the bad decisions that come along with not thinking. Also, when things become important, they evoke emotions and classes of thought that don't otherwise come out. For me, at least, deciding where to live made me think about what sorts of things made me happy, whether it was responsible for me to spend a certain amount of money, and how I should live my life. When I was deciding what internship I wanted, I had to ask myself what type of person I would be and what my decision said about my outlook. Big decisions can lead to a sort of soul searching, but people who go on soul searches don't always come back enlightened. Sometimes they do but sometimes they are blinded by forces of greed, fear, anxiety, jealousy, or anger. When you have a great insight about your values, you can make a good decision, but if you are blinded by emotion you might make a decision that is not only suboptimal but perhaps even irrational to an unemotional version of yourself. 
<br/><br/>
				While I'm pretty happy about our apartment, I'm mostly relieved. I think that with a lot of these big decisions you should aim to get a pretty good result and put a lot of effort into your pursuit. But the processes end up being tremendously stressful and pretty soon you feel like giving up even if every additional quantum of effort could yield huge benefit. I think my roommates were all intimidated by the process of finding housing that we put it off till much later than we should have and ended up having few good choices left. When I applied to colleges, I applied almost exclusively to ones that I thought I had a good chance of getting into; I probably should have aimed for more schools I had a lower chance to, but doing so would have been demoralizing and stressful so I didn't. I should have also began searching for internships earlier than I did, but I was intimidated and felt I didn't really know how to. It's quite likely that I'll put off getting research/won't get research in the future because of this same phenomena. It's tough to be strong and the most natural thing to happen is to get either intimidated/scared of the process or just generally tired and demoralized. I think realizing that it is a pattern that we, as humans, get scared/tired of important decisions will make it easier to keep going and also comforting when we realize we are in a point of stress.
<br/><br/>
				Also, if we realize that there are all sorts of scary adultish things in our lives, we won't feel as concerned with one. When you have multiple opportunities to do well, the impression of importance of one particular opportunity goes down. We naturally are more scared about tests when we feel we only have a single chance to do well. If I were able to remember that getting rejected by a company or girl/missing out on an apartment/doing badly on a test is always followed by a large number of similar opportunities (of which some number are highly likely to be better), I'd probably be able to stress less about each one. And if I stress less about each one, I'll probably also be able to avoid the emotional irrationality that comes with that stress. 
<br/><br/>
				Just from experience, I have already begun to feel this. Midterms aren't nearly as scary as they used to be and now I'm less likely to think that some new 'adult'-type thing (whether it be networking or laundry or discussing apartment agreements or making a resume) is actually hard and am more likely to think it's probably just tedious or un-fun (which seems to be generally true for these sorts of things). I think I'm also getting better with these things by thinking/writing about them in a sort of meta way (here) and talking about them with my friends. Just talking/writing about things you already sort of know (like that it's okay to not do perfectly well on every single thing) helps you emphasize it and 'use' the concept when you need it. That's why there's no magic page of important rules that you can read and suddenly have a much improved quality of life. You might understand each of the points made on the page, yes, but for them to actually impact you, your brain needs to marinate in the ideas for a while so that they get absorbed and are part of your internal system. You should spend decently large amounts of time thinking about important thoughts because that leads to those thoughts eventually becoming a part of you.
<br/><br/>
				Back to my experience of picking an apartment though. When we were first searching for apartments I felt like things like amenities and stuff mattered a lot, but time eroded that image, and by the end we seemed to all mostly care about space, location, and cost. I think objectively those are correctly the biggest things to worry about. It became a question of how much to emphasize each. We didn't come to a consensus on this but this year has taught me location is probably the biggest thing. What is unmentioned is that 'location', which make an impact on where you spend your time (indoors, at nearby cafes/restaurants/libraries/malls etc), also affect the type of people you interact with. The variance in people is huge and people can impact you in profound ways, so where you lives matters because of the people who will be around you. I did not realize this at all when I picked freshman housing last year and would have made a different decision if I did. Money, of course, is important but I think that for people who are ambitious in the sense that they think they'll make a fairly large amount of money over the course of their life, it can be unwise to try to save money. People tend to undervalue unearned money and overvalue spent money, so I think it's highly likely that one could try to be too cheap and lose out on opportunities to make much more money in the future. This isn't to say that you should not be cheap/frugal but that cheapness only makes sense if you can justify that your money will be worth more than whatever you're skipping out on and that your cheapness isn't, in any likely way, going to nontrivially lower the chance of success. For housing, different choices could mean several thousands of dollars for each of us, which admittedly is a lot of money. I think that we made the right decision when we chose a slightly more expensive apartment with sufficient space and good location. It's a bet on our ability to use the time we save from having to walk to do something meaningful with our lives. 
<br/><br/>
				For a lot of other people, large amounts of space and nice amenities seem to be very important. I personally haven't been very tempted by those so it's easy for me to dismiss them as being unimportant but I've also spent some time thinking about why I don't think those things are particularly valuable. I've been fortunate to grow up in a fairly large house and my dorm is big too. What I can say is that my dorm is a lot smaller than the house I lived in (even proportionally) and I don't really think the additional space of my house made me any happier. Of course there is a line here where if you have too little space, you can feel really uncomfortable and unproductive and that's actually bad. Rather my point is that really large amounts of space haven't empirically made my life any better and I haven't met many people who seem genuinely extra happy because they have a huge house. I really do care about a few amenities, specifically hot showers, but I think that things can go overboard fast. When I chose to live in Clark Kerr, I must say that I felt the architecture attracted me and when I decided not to go to UCLA, I felt pretty sad that Berkeley's building wasn't as beautiful as UCLA's. Over the past year, I've found that the architecture of Clark Kerr hasn't made me much happier, I don't miss UCLA's campus (and hardly think of the appearance of Berkeley's campus), and do in fact feel inconvenienced by the distance from my dorm to campus. My theory is that distance is a fixed, real physical cost that cannot really 'fade' into oblivion. The beauty of buildings and walls is nice, but when your mind is occupied with the realities of life, it's easy to forget about it. 
<br/><br/>
			I haven't moved in yet or lived in my new apartment, but I'm sure it'll be an interesting experience. When the time comes, I'll write an update.</p>

				<h2 id="post3">Some Thoughts on Learning CS</h2>
				<p>A friend recently asked me how she could get really good at CS. I responded with a pretty long message that captured some of the things I've learned since starting to do CS. I'm still a noob and am towards the start of my CS career, but I feel my thoughts could still be helpful for a beginner. I read a lot of Paul Graham and tend to paraphrase him a lot when I write, so some ideas presented here will definitely seem familiar to people who have read his essays. I said, with minor modifications, the following:
				<br/><br/>
					"You could probably get there if a couple things happened:
				<br/><br/>
					1) You really believed you could do it. I think the best way is to do quite a bit of CS quite quickly and make friends with people who are good at CS/math. First, once you see that you've gotten better fast you'll realize you can keep getting better fast and maybe even increase your speed at doing so. In other words if you realize you can accelerate how fast you're getting better at CS, you'll get more motivated and actually accelerate how fast you're getting better. Second, it's the people who are really good at CS that'll make you feel like you can do it too. Once you realize the legends of CS/math etc are just normal people who try hard and have a lot of fun with what they're doing you'll be able to do it too. Also, from my experience people who do great work make you feel that you can also do great work.
					<br/><br/>
					2) You get really involved in projects. Personal projects are a whole different side of CS than theory (like learning data structures and stuff like that) and different people are good at it. I think personal projects is less 'pure' than theory in the sense that you have to do more types of things while theory is largely based on your ability to manipulate symbols (which I think is quite largely in-born). Projects are something that more types of people can get good at and definitely use different skills. For example, people who are good at making projects need to know different systems should work together, how to learn about a technology, has to think about a user, has to be able to produce creative and new ideas, and has to have a sense of design. Theory requires a smaller but very deep level of skill at a subset of these things. So I think it's totally possible for you to get very, very good at projects even if you're not at the very, very top of CS classes. 
					<br/><br/>
					3. You get lots of good CS friends. Having good CS friends is also really for getting good at CS because they can tell you all the insider secrets about their projects, how to get started, and how to do well in industry. Also, seeing their projects means that you'll have a much better idea of what projects can/should be like and you'll have a much easier time getting started. Also, having people to talk about your tests with can make you better prepared for them. 
					<br/><br/>
					By now it should be apparent that these ideas are complementary and intertwined and not distinct. Basically to get really good at CS you need to get very focused and eventually obsessed with it. Whether you get really into projects or theory or research doesn't seem to matter nearly as much as the idea that you're really involved and having fun. I'm not claiming to be very good at CS, but I can say that these are the things that helped me go from being a complete noob in CS to where I am now. Hopefully that helps."

				<h2 id="post2">On Books and Book Reviews, and Some Book Reviews </h2>
						<p>This semester it had come to my attention that I hadn't read a book for literally years. I've read hundreds or thousands of articles in the past few years, some of high quality (I think the New Yorker culture section is one of the most concentrated places for interesting writing and in particular is a great place to witness one type of great writing style) and some of lower quality (almost all articles on most sites: TechCrunch, Yahoo, most stuff linked to on FB, much of wired, a lot of the random news in the NYTimes, lots of the 'news' in the New Yorker, Buzzfeed, etc). The thing about bad writing for people who love to read, is that you're still human and drawn to it, but because you love reading you feel bad about it afterwards. It's like a pastry chef surrounded by Oreos all the time; it's hard to resist them even though you know they aren't actually very good. </p>
						<p>That summarizes much guilt and pain I've experienced in the past few years. I've probably known it's been a big problem for a while, but only started to do something about it recently. I've blocked nearly all the media sites on my computer (even the ones that sometimes have good stuff like Reddit/Hacker News/New Yorker) in order to lower my consumption of bad media. The results have been generally good but there's still room for improvement. It's not uncommon for me to go on my phone and read bad news, but the overall frequency has gone down. Reading has always been how I spend a huge amount of my time and that hasn't changed that much since blocking most media sites on my computer, but has stayed around constant. What has changed is that I've started reading books (wow, we finally got back to my stated topic) and have realized how much more rewarding the experience is and how much great content there is to read in the world. </p>
						<p>I think I got lucky in that at least a few of the books I've read were really great and did a very good job of reminding me how good it can be to read a good book. I don't want this to be a self-help blog where I recommend things for you to do and make your life better, mostly because that doesn't seem fun for me. But you can read between the lines and figure out that the person writing this (me) probably thinks that if you haven't read a full book in a long time, you should probably try it. </p>
						<p>I think that it's a good idea for me to write some reviews about books I've written so I don't forget entirely that I even read them. I can also look back and see how my tastes have changed over time or what an earlier version of myself thought. I have a hunch that Bill Gates writes book reviews partly for these reasons. These reviews probably won't be amazing because I read them throughout the last semester and have already forgotten a lot of details about them, but I'll give you the gist of how I felt about them. You can read my last post about Steven Pinker's two books; Better Angels of Our Nature was both the longest and best book I read, partly because of the beauty of the ideas in the book and partly because it showed me I was able to read long books and not to be afraid of them.</p> 
						<p>I also read <b>Never Split the Difference</b>, which was semi-recommended to me a by friend, which was a book about negotiating written by some top hostage negotiator. Some of the book's ideas were pretty interesting like intentionally pausing during sentences and how the writer was able to guess what his negotiator was thinking. Unfortunately I quit this book about 2/3 of the way because I got sick of the writing which felt sensationalistic and too self-helpy. Generally I don't like writing that preaches a lot, not because I think it's 'an insult to my intelligence', but because I get a queasy feeling that the writer is being a sort of dishonest with me. The book had all these examples where somebody magically used his very, very specific advice and it was crucial to them getting some very important situation defused or reward obtained. Based on my understanding of people, situations, and probability, he's either making these things up, twisting the stories deeply, or collecting them from people who've already changed them. Regardless of which of those things happened, it left me as a reader distrusting and unpersuaded. I could try to make the point that it's ironic about how a book about negotiation (which is a form of persuasion) was not persuasive, but I think that applies to most books on persuasion for people like me. I don't think this book was any worse than the rest of the genre.</p>

						<p>As a young and ambitious person, I think a lot about career and what I should be doing with my life and why. I think for almost anyone who thinks of themself as ambitious, it's a little bit hard to not (at least temporarily) get attracted to things other people see as paths to success. One commonly regarded path to success is that of the investment banker (or trader or rising financial analyst), who goes to Wall Street and makes his millions. What's harder to ignore is that so many people who go to top schools, like Harvard & Princeton etc, end up working there, so it can't be a field just of stupid people. So on and off, I would imagine what it would be like to work at Wall St, read up about it and then come to the understanding that those people mostly don't enjoy their life, don't really necessarily make that much money, and aren't worthy of my envy, and then forget all the lessons I learned and get tempted by the allure again. I read a book called <b>Young Money</b> where a journalist follows and interviews a bunch of kids that go to Wall St for some reason or not. I think he picked a group of people generally nicer than the average subset of Wall St, but I mentally adjusted for that when using the book to shape my worldview. Also, him picking a nice group of people gave me some sense of empathy for Wall St, which is probably important for me to get a fairer understanding of the who goes into Wall St, why they do it, and how the whole system works. The most valuable part of reading Young Money is that now I have been mostly cured of my inclination to cyclically think highly of people going to Wall St. My thought process has been simplified to "Wall St -> Kids in Young Money -> Possibly Good People getting into a deeply stressful and unrewarding field -> hopefully they exit and find meaningful things to do that make them happy." It might sound silly but this one thing that I took away, in a fairly deep way, was enough to make the book worth my time. The writing wasn't excellent and I wasn't a fan of the style but I'm grateful to have read it for this one thing it taught me. Many lives have been destroyed or derailed by desires for things that aren't good in the long term. Wall Street seems to be such a thing. I wouldn't have gone to Wall St in any conceivable universe, but just having a better understanding of it and not being tempted is relieving and helpful for developing my world view.</p>

						<p>I read Jessica Livingston's <b>Founders at Work</b>, piecewise. I'm very interested in startups so I thought it was a generally fun read. It reminds me of the idea that sometimes you need to read sort of similar variations of the same idea to really deeply understand an idea. When you do a math problem on some topic, you won't be an expert after doing the one problem. If you do 5 isomorphic problems of the exact same structure (but changing particular details just so you aren't regurgitating details) you'll have a much better understanding of that topic, and measurably so. We're all told that you get better with practice, but it's rarely noted *how* unintuitive the idea of practice is. It's absolutely strange that if you do extremely similar things over and over, that you'll learn something new. Learning is by definition absorbing something new. How can you learn if the experience is largely not new? I think this is a fundamental question that is very hard to answer. My best answer is that there are two notions of 'new': newess to the brain and comparative-newness. Comparative-newness of two actions refers to analytically saying how the actions differ. Solving 12+10 at 9:00 AM is different from solving 12+10 at 11:00 AM is different only in terms of when you solved it, and that doesn't seem like a big difference. Our default mode of evaluating newness is by comparison. It's the most intuitive way and takes advantage of a method of thinking that we have a lot of experience in. But that's not actually how the brain works. Our brain works sort of like a muscle where it can gets better at doing something once you repeat it. This is highly un-intuitive because we think of information as being exact, perfectly stored data while we think of muscles as physical objects responding to some chemical process to grow. When you learn things, you're always something new so it's hard to realize that the process of learning involves repeating something over and over. For muscles, we have the explanation that tissue tears and then regrows better and stronger. We have no good, widely-circuited notion for the brain. Our model of information is based on that of a computer, where you insert data once and it's stored forever. We're trained to think of information systems as being highly formalized, lossless, and logical system because that is how the ones we design are. Our own hardware is totally different so we do a terrible job of thinking about it. The reason the book reminded me of this is that I've read so much startup advice that very little of it seems to be new to me. In fact, you could take all I know about startups and write it on a few pages. Paul Graham says something similar about what he remembers from history books. But it's deeply wrong and misleading to say what I know about startup advice would fit on a few pages because what I know about startups is not stored as information the way it is on computers, in a nice orderly fashion, in discrete bits and bytes. Worldviews are not stored as long strings of binary; we have basically little idea of how they're started. It would probably be good for everyone to realize that we use one model of analytic thinking for everything in the physical world and it works very well, but that we shouldn't apply that model to our own brains because our brains are special and odd things. Maybe some people do that, but I rarely do and think it'd be nice if we all talked about this. I had lunch with a friend who said she read the answers to a practice test she took, as if by reading the solutions she would learn them. If she were a computer, reading the solutions would be fine. But she's not. And it's not a coincidence that she decided to think that way. It's the natural thing to do. But it's highly dangerous because it inhibits learning and gives people bad habits. I don't think it would be that bad for us to aim for half of the population to learn very explicitly to think of our brains as weird hardware that requires lots and lots of practice and to note how different we are from computers. The idea of comparing our minds to computers should be done with extreme care and it should be reiterated how different they are. I understand this is a hard thing to learn and deeply internalize. However, if it was a common fact that practice is an unintuitive thing that doesn't apply to most systems in nature, I think it would be easier and more intuitive to adapt accordingly. Also this long post about how we learn which came out of what was supposed to be a book review probably indicates my blog won't be about things I say it'll be about and also that it'll go in ways I don't expect</p>

						<p>Steven Levitt's book <b>Think Like A Freak</b> was also self-helpy but I read it because a friend was reading it and I needed a break from Better Angels of Our Nature. It seemed to have a lot of specific advice that would work in a few solutions but aren't applicable all that often. I also read their first two books and generally read a lot of books of their style (Malcolm Gladwell-ey clever social science observation) which I find really entertaining but usually less useful than they appear. It also sounded as if these few lessons would dramatically change your life. I think my whole issue with self-help books is related to the above brain-practice-weirdness. Self-help is a whole genre stuck in this model that if you upload information to your brain, it can be better so you just need to read the inspirational words. Certain truths are actually super important to living, but those hard facts are almost diametrically opposite of the stuff in self-help books. Even if you want to learn the things in the self-help book, you can't, at least not by reading them. If you want to become kind, reading about kindness is a very weak way to do it. You need to experience kindness, experience being kind, experience a vacuum of kindness. The development of brain skills is not through the entry of books into the mind, but through experiences. What books are good for is actually getting new facts and getting some seeds that will blossom into good thoughts later. But skills need to be obtained by living life. It might be sad that you can't just learn everything from reading books. But you can go and live an exciting life *and* have your brain changed and be a transformed person! That's pretty cool. I know I'm talking a lot about how we poorly conceptualize the brain because it is such a generally weird (read non-normative) thing that can't be explained by the normal models of life but I think it's justified because of how important of a thought it is and because I just thought about it. Also, the experience of reading this whole post about it is probably going to help you understand it better than if I had written one very precise good sentence about it. So you are welcome for that and if you want to learn it even better, read this post a second time. It'll be fun then too. I promise.

						<p><b>Deep Work</b> was Cal Newport's book about, well, deep work. I liked this book a lot. The central idea is that there exists deep work that requires full concentration, that that type of work is rich, rare, and meaningful, and that you should do it. I think this is a great idea. People should be talking about deep work all the time. The best types of work are deep work. Deep work is sustainable and makes life better. When you do deep work you don't feel unproductive. I want to do deep work and I want all the people in my life to do deep work. This was the first book I read after my long hiatus and I'm happy it was. It got me out of my hiatus and inspired me to do deeper things - the general priority to block all the trash media was born from it. I think I summarized the book decently but if you read it you'll take deep work more seriously and that's a valuable thing. Sometimes just talking about a thing makes it a priority. I don't think that 'Awareness' campaigns work because being aware of something usually doesn't make you care. Talking and writing about things makes you care. And I'm writing about deep work because it's something worth caring about, and at the heart of a large portion of the great things in the world. Sometimes you need to just do stupid work to make the cycles of the world work. Most great endeavours have some amount of nonsense them. But most great endeavours have really high quality deep work in them. And only some people can do that high quality deep work. I'd like to be that type of person and am pretty sure it's a lot more fun than doing nonsense. </p>
						<p>I thought it fitting for my last book review to be for <b>The Long Goodbye</b>, for some sense of closure. It was the first novel I've read in, um, very long. It was interesting and fast paced and was especially impressive that it read totally normally even though it was written over 60 years ago. Timelessness is a virtue that we rarely talk about but seems to me to be very great. Thinking about things over a tremendously long time period is hard but very worth it. That was a good lesson I realized from Better Angels of Our Nature. The current model of thinking about life in context of what we've seen in perverse because we have so much history and are at one end of it. The world has changed tremendously so it's largely inaccurate to not think about it with respect to the long trailing history. I don't do that a good job of this because it's hard but I'd like to work on it. The slang was a bit different, there weren't any mentions of modern electronics, but mostly the book was deeply relatable. I guess what's dramatic and engaging in the 20th and 21st century need not be that different when it's based in something very slow changing: human nature. The book also reminded me that books take us places. I hadn't forgotten that novels could do that, in the sense that the idea seemed new to me. But I had forgotten the feeling and being shown the excitement once again made me excited. Now there's a whole new world (or universe really) for me to explore.</p>
						<p>So those are the books I read. This post was a lot longer than I expected. I think I found a form of writing I really like. Let's see if that continues to be true. If you read till here, I admire your determination. If you know me, I appreciate your appreciation of me, because if you read till here you really must like what I have to say. See you till next time. Also, I'll be trying to make this whole blog format better in the coming days, so check back for that! (By the way, I'm probably going to end most of my posts by asking you to come back because it's natural, easy, and blog posts aren't designed to lead to good rhetorically-satisfying conclusions).</p>

				<h2 id="post1">First Post!</h2>
						<p>Most first posts, like this, are test posts and tests posts tend not to be interesting. I'll try to make this post different. I recently read a great book. It's called <b>Better Angels of our Nature.</b> The book talks about all the ways that violence has gone down over the ages. It's around 800 pages which felt very long to me, especially because I read very few books in high school. Despite its length, the book was worth the time it took to read it. Since reading it, I sometimes see some real life phenomena and remember a theme of his book; this, I believe, is a good indication that this book made an impact on my worldview. The simple fact that early-era human life was so absolutely and horrifyingly painful to so many people so much of the time is so dramatic that it makes certain major pains of life seem somewhat trivial. I also read Pinker's second book, <b>Enlightenment Now,</b> but found it less interesting. It seemed like it was mostly full of stuff I already agree with.  But I imagine that if someone disagreed with a lot of its premises (like the idea that humanism, reason, science are sort of fundamental powers of good) then he/she would likely get a lot of the experience. My next post is going to be about books in general and some other specific books I wrote, so stay tuned!</p>
