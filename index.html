								<h2>Pictacular</h2>
								<h3>Photo Mosaic Maker</h3>
								<p>Pictacular is a mosaic maker. It takes some picture you give it (say, for example, an image of Mario) and recreates it by combining lots and lots of small images. The program has thousands of images to choose from, which helps the mosaic look very similar to the original given image. It's a concept that is better explained by an example than words, so scroll down to take a look.</p>
								<p> The naive solution would be to divy up the given photo into squares, find the average color of each square by averaging all the pixels in it, and then comparing the average color to the average color of every single photo in the database, finally replacing the square with the image that has the closest average color. This solution however is extremely, extremely slow. So slow, in fact, that you can't practically run it on your computer. </p>
								<p>I used dynamic programming to significantly speed up the process. First, I divided the RGB color space into 16**3 or 4096 equally sized color cubes. I mapped each color cube to the nearest picture. This took some a while to run, but after it finished I was able to cache it and use it for future calculations. Instead of comparing each square's average color to all the images in the database, I could instantly find a very close image by seeing what color cube our average color belonged to and getting the corresponding image. This reduced time to find an image from O(D), where we have D images in our database, to O(1). This was a great improvement because we have many images in our database and a very large D.</p>
								<p>To further improve speed, I approximated the average color of the given pixel, by only using pixels on every 15th row and 15th column. For a 225x225 image, this means sampling 225 pixels instead of 50,625 pixels, reducing the time to find the average color of a pixel by a factor of 225.</p>

								<h2>Tileman<h2>
								<h3>Tile Based Adventure Game</h3>
								<p>Tiler is an angsty teen, forever pained by the fact that he lives in a world made solely of tiles. In this Pokemon-style game, Tiler walks around endlessly, soothed only by the material comforts of coins, mushrooms, and shoes. Future updates may reveal that Tiler's world is more interesting than he thinks.</p>
								<p>This was actually the largest solo project I've built, currently at 500+ lines of extremely dense Python; I suspect it would be very hard to make it 20% more dense without sacrificing significant readability. It features random world generation, multiple representation of tiles for easy world-building and memory-efficiency, interactive tiles, keystroke processing, and smooth map rastering and updating.</p>
								<p>Building this game really taught me to have incredible respect for game studios; even though games often seem silly or 'just fun', they can involve very complex and serious systems that need to work in-lock. Even though Tileman seems like a very simple project, even compared to my other ones, it was a much more complex system to make work.</p>

							<article id="Cardy" >
								<h2>Cardy</h2>
								<h3>Virtual Postcard Sender</h3>
								<p>Cardy is a tool for sending virtual postcards to your friends via email. You tell it where you are and then it searches Flickr for scenic photos around you. Choose one, add a message, enter an email address and your postcard is sent! This is many times faster than the "naive, hand-written" approach to sending postcards. </i> One interesting thing to note is that email protocol doesn't verify the name of the sender, so it is conceivable that an email may not truly come from the apparent sender.</p>
								<p>Cardy is different from a lot of the other projects I make because it was more of a desktop app than a web app. This means that instead of using HTML/CSS/JS and the related technologies to build the front-end, I used Tkinter, a widget library. The paradigm shares some ideas with web-based user design, but lots of the ideas were new, which was a good learning experience for me. Overall, I think web technologies have a much richer environment and larger community but Tkinter was very good for getting a working prototype up and running on my computer without having to worry about makign AJAX calls. It was also a pretty fun experience because Tkinter is a python library which meant I got to use Python for both the front  and back end. That sort of luxury is usually reserved for JavaScript enthusiasts (client-side js + node.js) but this let me be king for a day.</p>
								<p> It was also fun stringing up a whole bunch of APIs together and getting a pretty cool result with not a whole lot of lines. The process sort of reminded me of IFTTT. The coolest thing was learning about the email exploit and sending a few friends 'emails from the future' sent from their own email address.</p>

							<!-- CS61A Grade Calculator -->
							<article id="GradeCalc">
								<h2>CS61A Grade Calculator</h2>
								<p>Towards the end of the Fall 2017 semester, many students in CS61a, the first programming course for majors, wanted to know their final grade. The problem was that the grade portal poorly communicated information about your grade; some projects would have multiple scores next to them, different types of assignments were worth different sorts of points, the grade system had mathematical rules about the limitations of those points, and there was no automatic point counter. </p>
								<p>In short, calculating your grade was a tedious and complex process very much prone to error. I figured programming a solution would not be *that* much harder than calculating my own grade and that my program would be more consistent than me. Also, all the other students would be able to use it as well!</p>
								<p>I used BeautifulSoup to scrape HTML that the user provided and used the library with some python scripts to extract their grade data (by looking for patterns and idiosyncracies with my own HTML file) and finally calculate the correct scores that corresponded to the course's grading criteria.</p>
								<p>It was also exciting that over 200 people used the program, according to Github's analytics. Most of my projects are just for me, so this was a unique experience and I'm glad I was able to save my peers from some degree of tedium.</p>

								<h2>Image-ine</h2>
								<h3>Recursive Image Generator</h3>
								<p>Image-ine is a simple recursive image generator. It was one of my first libraries using Pillow, wa fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and one of my favorite libaries to use in general, largely because it's well-designed and image-construction projects are always fun; even when you mess up you get an interestingly-wrong image instead of an error message or wrong number.</p>
								<p>The program takes in a user submitted square photo, and makes a grid of smaller copies of the photo. It tints all the images (using average-color data from the submitted photo), to make the final recursive image, which looks very much like the original. As you increase the number of photos, each photo becomes smaller and thus harder to see individually, but the overall image looks more and more like the original.</p>

								<h2>Cheadle Bio</h2>
								<h3>Freelance Website</h3>
								<p>Cheadle Bio is a freelance project I made for a biology teacher at my high school. It was a time to learn more about work on the front-end (many hours tweaking the base template to fit Mr.Cheadle's needs) and become more comfortable with client-side JavaScript. Freelancing taught me a lot, especially that software is often about solving the problem of the user and that means learning a lot about your user and their needs. As seen below, it includes two passwords protected links that take students to Google Drive folders that have various resources for learning more about biology.</p>

								<h2>PickIt</h2>
								<h3>Bookmarked Image Manager (Team Project)</h3>
								<p>PickIt was our team project at PennApps. I worked on writing the server-side Node.js APIs but my friend Anton, who I should mention is the smartest person I know and I know a lot of smart people, really carried the day for the whole project, hacking 3+ times faster than me and simply not sleeping.</p>
								<p>PickIt is a chrome-extension + website that lets you collect images online by right clicking and "PickIt"-ing them. It saves your images to the website, let's you tag them, and lets you search images based on tags. Basically, a rather primitive version of Pinterest. None of us are front-end experts so the front-end is a little plain, but the backend technology ended up being very cool and I was very excited that we were able to have all the parts of the system working together.</p>
								<p>It was a challenge for all of us because it was the first independent project that used AWS, databases, server-side code, a chrome extension, and front-end code all together. It was additionally challenging for me because it was my first nontrivial node.js/express project, the first time I've used a database at all for any project, and the first time I used anything from AWS. 
								<p>Much of my code got scrapped when we changed the specification of our database and we didn't win anything, but this was one of my favorite projects to have ever worked on. I got to work with Anton (who is one of my few best friends) after a long time (he goes to MIT which is pretty far from Berkeley), felt like I got a crash course in a host of important technologies, and also finally experienced working on a succesful team project. I'm grateful for the experience and am looking forward to PennApps round 3!</p>

								<h2>Blog</h2>
								<h3>First Post!</h3>
								<p>Most first posts, like this, are test posts and tests posts tend not to be interesting. I'll try to make this post different. I recently read a great book. It's called 'Better Angels of our Nature.' The book talks about all the ways that violence has gone down over the ages. It's around 800 pages which felt very long to me, especially because I read very few books in high school. Despite its length, the book was worth the time it took to read it. Since reading it, I sometimes see some real life phenomena and remember a theme of his book; this, I believe, is a good indication that this book made an impact on my worldview. The simple fact that early-era human life was so absolutely and horrifyingly painful to so many people so much of the time is so dramatic that it makes certain major pains of life seem somewhat trivial. I also read Pinker's second book, 'Enlightenment Now,' but found it less interesting. It seemed like it was mostly full of stuff I already agree with.  But I imagine that if someone disagreed with a lot of its premises (like the idea that humanism, reason, science are sort of fundamental powers of good) then he/she would likely get a lot of the experience. I hope you consider reading 'Better Angels of Our Nature.' And I hope this test post was less dull than others you may have read.</p>
