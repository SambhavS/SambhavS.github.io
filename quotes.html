              <h3>Oh my! You've found my page of quotes.</h3>
              <li>"...advocating Object-Oriented Programming is like advocating Pants-Oriented Clothing" 
              <br>- Jacob Gabrielson </li>
              <li>"Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons" 
              <br>- Popular Mechanics Magazine (Creds to Anton)</li>
              <li>"I want you on my team" "So does everybody else"  
              <br>- Timbaland, Nelly Furtado</li>
              <li>"I’m not in the habit of getting naked during meetings at startup offices, but this time it felt appropriate."
              <br>- Lucas Matney</li>
              <li>"What's the difference between a booty and a butt?"
              <br>- RJ</li>
              <li>"Learning is valuable in and of itself if – and it’s a big if – the learning is interesting."
              <br>- Aaron Harris</li>  
              <li style="color:white">"Lily was a nice little flower. It would be silly to think otherwise. She was so pretty, so sweet, so lovely. Oh how the leaves looked at her. But sometimes sweetness can get excessive. Lily became obsessed with the attention she got. She dined exclusively with the other pretty flowers, like Jasmine and Daisy, making the other flowers so jealous. She started to think that only the pretty flowers should have their buds pollinated. Why, after all, should we let the ugliness of the Geraniums and Sunflowers pollute the world? So she ran for president. She got elected; hardly anyone could resist the arguments presented in her oh-so-beautiful voice. However, just as she set out to execute her evil plan, she realized that all flowers have feelings and needed a family. Horrified by her actions, she locked herself in an abandoned castle and decided she ought to take a walk and think about her actions. Ruminate about the pain and suffering you've caused as you walk around the empty basement as Lily, the most delightfully twisted ruler that almost was."
